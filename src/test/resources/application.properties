# This problem's caused by a bug in Springfox. It's making an assumption about how Spring MVC is set up that doesn't always hold true. Specifically, it's assuming that MVC's path matching will use the Ant-based path matcher and not the PathPattern-based matcher. PathPattern-based matching has been an option for some time now and is the default as of Spring Boot 2.6.
# As described in Spring Boot 2.6's release notes, you can restore the configuration that Springfox assumes will be used by setting spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy to ant-path-matcher in your application.properties file. Note that this will only work if you are not using Spring Boot's Actuator. The Actuator always uses PathPattern-based parsing, irrespective of the configured matching-strategy. A change to Springfox will be required if you want to use it with the Actuator in Spring Boot 2.6 and later.
